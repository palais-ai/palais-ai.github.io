<p>
PALAIS is a 3D virtual simulation environment for artificial intelligence with a special focus on games. Most work done on game AI requires a sandbox environment to evaluate behaviors. Traditionally, home-made projects built on top of general game engines would be used to serve as sandbox environments. 
</p>
<p>
	While valid, this approach requires significantly more game development know-how and programming effort than using a domain-specific environment. PALAIS comes with a full scripting environment, a plugin system, project management, knowledge inspection, an intuitive programming interface, simulation control and data visualisation tools. 
<p>
Implementing these features in a traditional game engine requires months of work and vast game engine know-how. Using PALAIS is free and setting up a project <a href="{{ "/tutorials/creating-a-new-project/"  | prepend: site.baseurl }}">takes minutes</a>. The scripting interface is <a href="{{ "/documentation/"  | prepend: site.baseurl }}">minimal</a> and can be accessed via simple JavaScript, one of the most prevalent and easy-to-learn programming languages.
</p>

<p>
On top of that PALAIS projects can easily be shared with other people, making it easy to teach game AI, collaborate with peers and to showcase your algorithms and behaviors.
</p>

</p>
<p>
In short, PALAIS' goal is to provide a platform that facilitates <em>development</em>, <em>showcasing</em>, <em>education</em> and <em>research</em> of artificial intelligence in games.
</p>

<h2>How Does My Project Benefit?</h2>
<p>
PALAIS can jump-start your project by providing an easy-to-use, cross-platform, accessible and extensible environment with most of the functionality you are looking for already available. 
</p>

<h2>Background</h2>
<p>
	PALAIS was created as part of a larger project to build and evaluate a unified framework for aritificial intelligence in games at the research group <a href="http://cs.univie.ac.at/research/research-groups/entertainment-computing/">Entertainment Computing</a> at the <a href="http://cs.univie.ac.at/">Institute of Computer Science</a> of the <a href="http://www.univie.ac.at/">University of Vienna</a>. It is made available to the public in the hope that it's a useful tool for other projects as well.
