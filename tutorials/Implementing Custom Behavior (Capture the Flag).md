	<h2>Learning Goal</h2>
	<p>
		This tutorial is meant to provide an introduction to the more advanced features of PALAIS and to show how the features of PALAIS can be combined to create arbitrarily complex scene logic and agent behaviors.
	</p>
	<h2>Description</h2>
	<p>
	 	This project showcases the usage of most of the features available in the scripting system of PALAIS. The scene itself depicts a typical Capture the Flag scenario. The actors in the scene are controlled by a event-based Behavior Tree.
	</p>
	<p>
		A more thorough description of the source code will be provided soon.
